        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            In 2023, I graduated with a bachelor’s degree from the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music in Budapest, specializing in Electronic Music Media Arts under the supervision of Dr. Andrea Szigetvári.
            I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Electronic Music at the Hochschule für Musik Hanns Eisler Berlin, in the class of Prof. Wolfgang Heiniger.
            My main areas of focus are interdisciplinary projects, spatial audio, and live performance with self-developed instruments.
            My compositions have been performed at various venues and festivals in Krakow, Poland; Karlsruhe and Berlin, Germany; Vienna and Graz, Austria; as well as in multiple locations across Hungary.

    <h3>INSIDE</h3>
    <p>
        Composition for dancer Eva Melnikova's bachelor graduation performance at the Berlin Dance Institute.
        The work, entitled "INSIDE", was both a musical composition and a stage production. Its theme revolved around confronting inner fears and the fundamental question of whether one even needs to face them at all.
        This collaboration enabled me to expand my artistic practice into the field of contemporary dance and to explore how music can embody psychological states within a performative context.

            <h3>WHITE</h3>
            <p>
                My spatial audio composition "White" is woven from only human voice. On stage, singer Panna Dobos performs alongside her own recorded self — one body, two layers. In this dialogue, past and present, moment and timelessness entwine. The piece evokes the pain of leaving home, the impossibility of return, and the quiet tremors of grief.

    <h3>D2</h3>
    <p>
        In this composition, I explore the existence of tribal instruments, the human singing voice, and the ancient energies hidden within electronic music.
        The piece features the sounds of the didgeridoo played by me, blending with the harmonies of an old Hungarian folk song and other electronic sounds.
        The audiovisual score presents the composition through the fusion of human and nature, the natural and the artificial.

    <h3>D3</h3>
    <p>
        In this improvisation, I use a spatial improvisation instrument that I developed myself.
        With this instrument, I can record, manipulate, and move sounds through space in real time – solely with the shadow of my hand.
        By casting my hand’s shadow onto the sensors placed on the instrument, I am able to manipulate the sound live.
        The sound source of the instrument is an old Hungarian instrument called Tilinkó, whose sound I transform in real time during the improvisation.
        The aim of the improvisation is to explore the connection between folk instruments and electronic music.

    <p>
        The D5 is an advanced version of the D3, where I use a MUGIC sensor to control the electronic component.
